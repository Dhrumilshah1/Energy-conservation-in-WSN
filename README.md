Energy Optimization in WSN Using Deep Learning with Sparse Autoencoders
Energy is a limited and precious resource in wireless sensor networks (WSNs), particularly in environments where replenishing the energy supply is unfeasible. Even when energy harvesting is possible, optimizing energy consumption remains crucial for extending the network's operational life. Prolonging network longevity through efficient energy management is a cornerstone of designing robust WSNs.

In this study, I employed deep learning techniques to optimize energy usage in WSNs. Specifically, a sparse autoencoder was used to minimize the size of sensor data collected from the environment. The encoder compresses the data before transmission, reducing energy expenditure, while the decoder at the sink reconstructs the original data.

The Dataset
The dataset utilized consists of forest observations from four distinct areas within the Roosevelt National Forest, Colorado. These observations, collected over 30x30-meter forest sections, provide cartographic data, not reliant on remote sensing. With over 500,000 entries, the dataset captures information on tree species, shadow cover, distances to landmarks like roads, soil classifications, and topographical details.
